\section{Non-technical Summary}

  The UMA Data Verification Machine (DVM) is responsible for producing ``honest'' prices that can be
  used to evaluate financial smart contracts on the blockchain. The DVM relies on votes by
  individuals who own UMA vote tokens to accurately report prices from the fiat world. In order to
  ensure that the DVM cannot be manipulated for financial gain, we establish conditions under which
  it is not economically profitable to corrupt the system by purchasing enough tokens to corrupt the
  DVM by voting dishonestly\footnote{There are other attacks that involve bribing voters to take a
  particular action, but we address these concerns in a different research document}.

  The tool we use to incentivize honest behavior is to conduct buybacks of the UMA vote token from
  token holders.  We view these buybacks as a way to ensure that there are positive returns paid for
  holding vote tokens. We prevent corruption by ensuring that the expected present discounted value
  of all future buybacks exceeds the amount that an individual could gain by corrupting the system.
  These buybacks are financed through a mixture of current taxes on the margin in the system and a
  ``rainy day fund'' which is savings held from unspent margin taxes from the past. We build a
  mathematical model that describes these interactions and lay out the conditions necessary to
  ensure that there is no economically profitable corruption opportunities.

  We find that

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The executed buybacks at high levels of margin are typically higher than the buybacks at
          lower levels of margin.
    \item The expectation of growth in the total margin secured by the DVM coupled with the fact
          that there are higher levels of buybacks at higher levels of margin results in the system
          being secure with low (or zero) buybacks in its early stages. Depending on beliefs about
          margin growth and realized margin growth, this results in the system being secure for a
          non-trivial amount of time (10+ years) without the need to implement buybacks.
    \item When the system's ``rainy day fund'' is empty, taxes must be weakly larger than the
          buybacks which occur for each level of margin. Additionally, for certain levels of margin
          that have positive buybacks, the system collects more in taxes than needed so that it can
          use those funds to finance future buybacks in states where there are higher required
          buybacks.
  \end{enumerate}

  These findings motivate our proposed taxation structure which levies low taxes while the system
  is growing and then uses a pro-cyclical tax structure with higher taxes when margin is high
  relative to its persistent level.

\section{Technical Details}

  We now move on to describe the technical details of our findings.

  The core argument will revolve around what we call the ``Profit from Corruption (PfC) less than
  Cost of Corruption (CoC)'' inequality ($PfC < CoC$). Preserving this inequality ensures that no
  individual can profitably corrupt the DVM.

  Throughout this work, we assume that the PfC is proportional to the amount of margin that is held
  in the system, $\text{PfC} = \gamma M_t$, and that the CoC is equal to buying sufficient vote
  tokens to corrupt the system\footnote{There are other types of attacks in which individuals can
  offer bribes to individual voters in order to incentivize them to corrupt the system --- We have
  forthcoming work in which we can show that the cheapest attack on our system involves a 51\%
  attack}, $\text{CoC} = \chi p_t S_t$ where $p_t$ denotes the dollar price of the UMA vote tokens,
  $S_t$ denotes the outstanding volume of tokens, and $\chi$ tells us what fraction of the tokens
  are needed to corrupt the system. We will also rely on the assumption that the market price for
  tokens are accurate --- Namely that if $X_t$ are the dollar amounts of buybacks in each period
  $t$ and $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, then the market cap of the token would be
  $p_t S_t = E_t \left[ \sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1 + r}\right)^s X_t \right]$.
  Our baseline assumption will be that the proportion of margin that can be stolen is $\frac{1}{2}$
  and the fraction of tokens required to corrupt is $\frac{1}{2}$.

  In each of the following subsections, we will use the notation presented below

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $B_t$ denotes the number of tokens bought back prior to vote
    \item $D_t$ denotes the dollar value of funds held in the ``rainy day fund''
    \item $M_t$ denotes total dollar value of margin in system
    \item $\tau_t$ denotes the tax rate on the system
    \item $p_t$ denotes the price (in dollars) of a single vote token
    \item $S_t$ denotes the number of vote tokens outstanding
    \item $F_t \equiv \tau_t M_t$ denotes total fee levied on system
    \item $X_t \equiv B_t p_t$ denotes the dollar value of expenditure on buybacks
  \end{itemize}

  Additionally the following are parameters

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\chi$ is the fraction of voters required to corrupt the system
    \item $\eta$ is percent of people who do not vote
    \item $\gamma$ the fraction of margin seized if DVM is corrupted
    \item $\pi$ is the inflation rate used to reward voters
    \item $r$ is the risk-free return on other investments
  \end{itemize}

  We can expand and rearrange the $PfC < CoC$ inequality to express the price needed to secure the
  system.

  \begin{align*}
    PfC_t &\leq CoC_t \\
    &\Rightarrow \gamma M_t \leq \frac{1 - \eta}{2} p_t S_t \\
    &\Rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}
    &\Rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}
  \end{align*}

  Thus as long as the price of a token is higher than $\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}$,
  then it will not be profitable to corrupt the system.

  The remaining analysis is done in pieces. We start with the simplest possible model and slowly
  add additional features to deepen our insights. We briefly describe these sections:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:dss} asks the question, ``In a deterministic world in which the system
          margin has reached a steady level of margin, what is the lowest tax rate we can implement
          that ensure incorruptibility?'' We find that the lowest tax rate achievable is the same
          as the return that we would like the tokens to offer.
    \item Section \ref{sec:dg} asks the question, ``If we knew exactly how margin would grow
          in the future, what is the minimum amount of taxes that we could impose at each
          period while maintaining the $PfC < CoC$ guarantee?'' We find that the rate of change in
          the tax rates is similar to the rate of change of the margin held in the system. We find
          that, under a particular parameterization, we can achieve a zero tax rate for almost 20
          years before being required to increase taxes to steady state amounts.
    \item Section \ref{sec:sm} analyzes a model in which margin follows a stochastic process and
          thinks about the right way to smooth taxes while maintaining the ability to make payments
          that ensure the system is ``incorruptible.''

\section{Conclusion}

This document explores potential policies that allow UMA's DVM to support honest prices.

It explores three (related) mathematical models which explore the necessary conditions for DVM
corruption to be unprofitable for attackers. We demonstrate how UMA could secure the DVM using a
mixture of fees and token buybacks and propose a loose structure for how to implement these
policies.
