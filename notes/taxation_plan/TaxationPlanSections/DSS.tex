In this version of the model, we will consider the system margin being constant over time, i.e.
$M_t = \bar{M}$ $\forall t$. However, it is important to note that not all of the variables will be
constant in the steady state because there is potentially non-zero inflation in the number of
outstanding tokens.

The total number of tokens follows

\begin{align*}
  S_{t+1} &= (1 + \pi) (S_t - B_t)
\end{align*}

Also, recall that the price that ensures $PfC < CoC$ is given by
$p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_t}{S_t}$.

The token market cap, $p_t S_t$, will be a constant since

\begin{align*}
  p_t S_t &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_t}{S_t} S_t \\
  &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} PfC_t \\
  &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \gamma M_t \\
  &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \gamma \bar{M}
\end{align*}

Assume that we'd like to achieve an aggregate period-by-period return of $r$ to token holders.

\begin{align*}
  (1 + r) &= \frac{p_{t+1} (S_{t+1} + B_{t+1})}{p_t S_t} \\
  (1 + r) &= \frac{p_{t+1} S_{t+1} + X_{t+1}}{p_t S_t} \\
  (1 + r) &= \frac{\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_{t+1}}{S_{t+1}} S_{t+1} + X_{t+1}}{\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_{t}}{S_t} S_t} \\
  (1 + r) PfC_{t} &= PfC_{t+1} + \frac{1 - \eta}{2} X_{t+1}
\end{align*}

In the SS this means that

\begin{align*}
  (1 + r) \bar{PfC} &= \bar{PfC} + \frac{1 - \eta}{2} \bar{X} \\
  &\rightarrow \bar{X} = \frac{2 \bar{PfC}}{1 - \eta} r
\end{align*}

If we assume that $\bar{PfC} = \frac{1}{2} \bar{M}$ and that there is full participation then this
reduces to $\bar{X} = r \bar{M}$ which means that the fee rate is given by,

$$\bar{\tau} \equiv \frac{\bar{X}}{\bar{M}} = r$$

The question of how high fees should be in the steady state depend on what one believes about the
return that token holders are willing to accept on their tokens.

If the following three things were true,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Blockchains become a widely accepted and used technology
  \item UMA was core to decentralized finance
  \item People were confident that UMA would continue to be a core component of decentralized finance
\end{enumerate}

then it is feasible that token holders would accept interest rates near the risk-free rate. Under
current market conditions, this could translate into a required annualized fee rate of between 2\%
and 5\%, but, even in more ``investor friendly times,'' this should not exceed 5\%-10\%.
